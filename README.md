DUNGEON HUNTER


This project consists in creating a small arcade style game that can be played in your web browser. 
The game allows you to move a character in a dungeon filled with traps and treasures. 
When the character finds a treasure, he earns points. 
If he falls into a trap instead, he loses energy. 
The goal is simply to collect as many points as possible before the player's energy drops to zero. 





RULES : 
The game must keep a score for the player. Depending on the player's actions, he will gain or lose points: 
- If the hero falls on a treasure coin, he gains 1000 points 
- If the hero steps on a trap, he loses 50 points 
- If the hero steps on an empty tile, he loses 10 points
